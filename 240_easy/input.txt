According to a research team at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter in what order the letters in a word are, 
the only important thing is that the first and last letter be in the right place. 
The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without a problem.
This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself, but the word as a whole. 
Such a condition is appropriately called Typoglycemia.
