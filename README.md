My solutions for problems pasted in /r/dailyprogrammer. They are
organized by their numbers, and are/will be typically solved in
Python 3.

Each directory will be structured as follows:

    000/
     |-- README.md : problem statement
     |-- solution_000.py : problem solution
     |-- test_generator.py : other supporting scripts
     |-- test1.in : input files
     +-- test2.in ...

want with them. Enjoy!
